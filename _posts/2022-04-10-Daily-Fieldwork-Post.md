## 10 April 2022

### *Respirometry - Photosynthesis and Respiration*
To measure photosynthesis and respiration for the timepoint 4 fragments (n=24) we followed the Putnam Lab [respirometer manual](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/Respirometry_Manual.md). Since our set up in Mo'orea has two six chamber respirometer stands, we did three separate runs with n=8 fragments with one blank on each stand for a total of n=10 chambers per run. We first took molecular samples of each fragment with one ~0.5-1 cm biopsy preserved in 1 mL of RNA/DNA shield and one ~0.5-1 cm biopsy snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in the Gump Molecular -40 C freezer. We set our light levels to ~610 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (51% on the AI lights) following our PI cuvre calculations to measure photosynthesis for ~20 minutes or until a consistent reading was achieved and then we turn off the lights and conducted light-enhanced dark respiration for ~20 minutes or until a consistent reading was achieved. After each trial was completed, volumes were measured from the chambers and the physiological fragments were snap frozen and stored in the Gump Molecular -40 C freezer in whirl paks.

## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the tenth day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.5 °C to 30.2 °C.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies and completed a daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Bleaching score processing*
Following Emma Strands [Bleaching Score Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-28-ImageJ-Analysis-Protocols.md#-bleaching_score) Emma, Hollie, Kristen, and Danielle have started processing the daily colony photos to track when the ambient and hot colonies start to differ in bleaching score. They have been updating the [Photographic Bleaching Script](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/RAnalysis/scripts/Photographic_Bleaching.pdf) often to make these comparisons and consult on moving forward. 

It appears that the bleaching score in the colonies experiencing the heat stress have continued to decline. We see a significant difference in the interaction between treatment and day.

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
