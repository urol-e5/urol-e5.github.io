### *Respirometry - Photosynthesis and Respiration*
To measure photosynthesis and respiration for the timepoint 4 fragments (n=24) we followed the Putnam Lab [respirometer manual](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/Respirometry_Manual.md). Since our set up in Mo'orea has two six chamber respirometer stands, we did three separate runs with n=8 fragments with one blank on each stand for a total of n=10 chambers per run. We first took molecular samples of each fragment with one ~0.5-1 cm biopsy preserved in 1 mL of RNA/DNA shield and one ~0.5-1 cm biopsy snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in the Gump Molecular -40 C freezer. We set our light levels to ~610 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (51% on the AI lights) following our PI cuvre calculations to measure photosynthesis for ~20 minutes or until a consistent reading was achieved and then we turn off the lights and conducted light-enhanced dark respiration for ~20 minutes or until a consistent reading was achieved. After each trial was completed, volumes were measured from the chambers and the physiological fragments were snap frozen and stored in the Gump Molecular -40 C freezer in whirl paks.
