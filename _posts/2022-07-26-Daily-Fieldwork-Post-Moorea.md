### *Symbiont counts*

Continued symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 40 corals collected in April 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries). 

### *Field sampling preparation*

Labeled all test tubes for *Acropora pulchra* (n=40) and *Pocillopora spp.* (n=10) sampling tomorrow (physiological whirl packs, histology, and molecular). 

### *Trainings*

Danielle met with Hendrikje and Rayna to go over the [Respirometry Protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/tree/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol) and set up in the small meso room.

Danielle also taught Janya some boating skills for sampling tomorrow.
