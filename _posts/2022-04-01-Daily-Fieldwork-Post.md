## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the first day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.0 °C to 29.7 °C.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), Danielle weighed all 322 pre-burned pans using an analytical balance with 0.00001 accuracy. She also loaded the symbiont and host tissue slurry from January, March, April, and some of heatwave TP1 into the pans and placed them into the drying oven so that they could reach a constant weight after 24 hours.

## *Airbrushing*

Lauren followed the [airbrushing protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) and recorded the homogenate volumes for all TP3 samples.

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments as well as tissue homogenate volumes can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
