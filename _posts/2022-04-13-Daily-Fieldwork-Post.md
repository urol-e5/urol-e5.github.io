## 13 April 2022

### *April 2022 Field Day Sampling - Forereef Pocillopora*
Danielle and Alex dove at ~12 meters on the forereef of Mo'orea to a site outside of 'Ōpūnohu Bay (17°29'07.1"S 149°51'30.3"W) with our [CRIOBE ](http://www.criobe.pf) collaborators for our monthly sampling of *Pocillopora* outside the backreef. Following the [Field Sampling Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Field-Sampling-Protocol.md), we collected ten ~4-5 inch fragments of *Pocillopora* that had been previously tagged for the first timepoint of this sampling on February 12th 2022 by Alex. The samples were collected and brought back to Gump Station for same day processing. For all sampling locations, a close up photo with the tag was taken. Additionally, a bleaching score photo was taken at each sampling location. If a tag was not found, we sampled from the same colony that the tag should have been located on.

### *Same Day Processing*
After collecting the samples, Danielle and Alex followed the [Same Day Sample Processing Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Sample_Same_Day_Processing_Protocol.md) to prepare samples for histological analysis, molecular and physiological downstream processing.

### *Bleaching Score Photos*
All bleaching score photos were downloaded off of the [Canon G7X ](https://www.fnac.com/Compact-Canon-PowerShot-G7X-Mark-II/a9570061/w-4) camera number 2 and uploaded to [Pocillopora_Sampling_Colony_Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1203vZyktuA_R3KwnG9uSV3JXkkiTA-um) for the April forereef 2022 timepoint (TP3). 

### *Data*
All timepoint and tracking data sheets for the April 2022 timepoint for [*Pocillopora*](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1w3KdwBZaaAFh8UdbOXM3KZCofldOC53i) on the forereef were updated. 

### *Heatwave*
Danielle started the thirteenth day of the heatwave period and the beginning of the decline for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.3 °C to 30.0 °C. Through our heatwave analyses, the climatological data shows that in Mo'orea at our site in the backreef, temperatures above 29.6 °C longer than a five day period is considered a heatwave.

### *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies and completed a daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

### *Bleaching score processing*
Following Emma Strands [Bleaching Score Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-28-ImageJ-Analysis-Protocols.md#-bleaching_score) Emma, Hollie, Kristen, and Danielle have started processing the daily colony photos to track when the ambient and hot colonies start to differ in bleaching score. They have been updating the [Photographic Bleaching Script](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/RAnalysis/scripts/Photographic_Bleaching.pdf) often to make these comparisons and consult on moving forward. 

It appears that the bleaching score in the colonies experiencing the heat stress have continued to decline. We see a significant difference in the interaction between treatment and day.

### *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
