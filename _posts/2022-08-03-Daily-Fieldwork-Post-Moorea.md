### *Aliquoting*

After airburshing and freezing the samples in a -40 C freezer, *Pocillopora* TPC samples were aliquoted following the aliquoting steps at the end of the [airbrushing](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) protocol for samples that will be used for [symbiont densities](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md), [chlorophyll content](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md), symbiont [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), host [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), and [tissue biomass](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md).

### *Surface Area*
Danielle followed the [surface area protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-02-17-Surface-Area-Protocol.md) and recorded surface area measurements for all the May, June, July, and *Pocillopora* TPC coral samples.

### *Symbiont counts*

Continued symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 40 corals collected in June 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries).
