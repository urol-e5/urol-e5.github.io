### *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), we labeled and made 310 aluminum pans to be pre-burned. We processed the May, June, and July *Acropora pulchra* samples for a total of 120 samples. Since we process both symbiont and host portions for tissue biomass, a total of 240 pans are needed. Also, we processed the *Pocillopora* TPC samples for a total of 32 samples, with 64 needed for host and symbiont. With a total of 304 pans needed and an extra 6 to burn in case of any mistakes.

### *Chlorophyll*
Completed the [chlorophyll quantification protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md) for June and July *Acropora pulchra* samples and the *Pocillopora*  TPC samples.

### *Symbiont counts*

Started symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 40 corals collected in July 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries).
