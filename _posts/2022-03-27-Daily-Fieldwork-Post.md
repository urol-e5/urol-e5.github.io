## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the heatwave ramp period and adjusted the APEX unit outlets to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 28.8 °C to 29.5 °C. During the night, the breaker was tripped due to the heaters all being on at once. 

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
