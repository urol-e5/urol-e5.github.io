## *Airbrushing*
Lauren airbrushed all samples for TP4 as well as 10 *Pocillopora* samples from January 2022. Homogenate volumes will be recorded tomorrow after homogenizing the samples.

## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the eleventh day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.5 °C to 30.2 °C.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies and completed a daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Bleaching score processing*
Following Emma Strands [Bleaching Score Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-28-ImageJ-Analysis-Protocols.md#-bleaching_score) Emma, Hollie, Kristen, and Danielle have started processing the daily colony photos to track when the ambient and hot colonies start to differ in bleaching score. They have been updating the [Photographic Bleaching Script](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/RAnalysis/scripts/Photographic_Bleaching.pdf) often to make these comparisons and consult on moving forward. 

It appears that the bleaching score in the colonies experiencing the heat stress have continued to decline. We see a significant difference in the interaction between treatment and day.

## *Photosynthesis and respiration data analyses*
Danielle analyzed photosynthesis and respiration rates for the ambient and hot colonies from timepoint 1 through timepoint 4. There was starting to be a split between the treatments in the respiration rates with higher rates in the hot treatment and a small increase in the ambient photosynthesis rates. All data can be found in the timepoint folders in the PR section in the [Heatwave GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/heatwave/timeseries).

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
