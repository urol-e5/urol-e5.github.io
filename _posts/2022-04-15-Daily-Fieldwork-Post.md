## 15 April 2022

## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the fifteenth day of the heatwave period and the beginning of the decline for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.1 °C to 29.8 °C. Through our heatwave analyses, the climatological data shows that in Mo'orea at our site in the backreef, temperatures above 29.6 °C longer than a five day period is considered a heatwave.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies and completed a daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Bleaching score processing*
Following Emma Strands [Bleaching Score Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-28-ImageJ-Analysis-Protocols.md#-bleaching_score) Emma, Hollie, Kristen, and Danielle have started processing the daily colony photos to track when the ambient and hot colonies start to differ in bleaching score. They have been updating the [Photographic Bleaching Script](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/RAnalysis/scripts/Photographic_Bleaching.pdf) often to make these comparisons and consult on moving forward. 

It appears that the bleaching score in the colonies experiencing the heat stress have continued to decline. We see a significant difference in the interaction between treatment and day.

## *Histological processing*
Following the histological processing protocol [in progress] Danielle and Lauren began the decalcification process on one replicate sample takem from the coral gametogenesis monthly sampling from December (n=41), January (n=37), February (n=36), March (n=40), and April (n=40) (total n=193). 

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
