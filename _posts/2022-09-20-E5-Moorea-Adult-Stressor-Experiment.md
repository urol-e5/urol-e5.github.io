This post includes the full notebook for Sept-Dec 2022 *Acropora pulchra* adult coral experiment Moorea, French Polynesia. These notebook posts are updated in order of most recent to oldest.

# Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to expose adult *Acropora pulchra* corals to conditions that elicit changes in symbiotic and metabolic condition and test how these changes influence response to a repeat stressor. Here, we are manipulating light and feeding conditions to elicit metabolic and symbiotic responses and testing stress response at the end of the experiment using the thermal stress CBASS system. The team will expose adult corals to light with added food, light with no added food, and shade with added food in Sept - Dec with thermal stress phenotype measurement in Dec with S. Matsuda and R. Cunning.

# 30 September 2022  

### *Daily measurements*  

Ariana took daily measurements at 0945-1020. Fragments look clean and healthy, no mortality observed. Flow adjusted to be between 350 and 400 mL per 5 sec in all tanks.  

Daily measurements for today were recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements).  

### *Preparing adult sampling*  

In the next couple of days Ariana will sample n=4 randomly selected fragments of each genotype to characterize baseline values of our responses of interest including DNA methylation and chromatin structure, gene expression, metabolomics, microbial communities, and physiology. Fragments were selected by randomly selecting n=4 per genotype such that each fragment was from a different tank and sampling from each tank was balanced to keep fragment density consistent.   

Today, Ariana identified the fragments to be sampled and prepared and labeled all tubes, whirlpacks, and equipment that will be used. 

Baseline sampling will be conducted following the protocol written by Ariana today. The [baseline sampling protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-30-Moorea-E5-Apulchra-Metabolism-Baseline-Sampling-Protocol.md) details procedures taking photographs of selected fragments for gene expression, microbial communities (16S and ITS2), chromatin structure and DNA methylation, metabolomics, and physiology. 

**The fragments that will be sampled are:**  
A7, 16, 20, 31  
B9, 20, 25, 34  
C1, 19, 26, 30    
D4, 13, 26, 30  
E5, 8, 20, 31  
F2, 9, 17, 22  

**Labeling equipment**  

2 mL screw cap cryo tubes were labeled in preparation for sampling as nubmers 1-96. The number was written on the top cap of each tube as well as on the side. "E5 Metab. 2022" was also added on the side of each tube to identify the project. To see details on organization and labeling for baseline sampling, [see the detailed protocol here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-30-Moorea-E5-Apulchra-Metabolism-Baseline-Sampling-Protocol.md).  

Tubes #1-48 were filled with 1 mL of RNA DNA Shield. All tube ID's and associated fragment and method of preservation were planned and recorded in the [sample inventory](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/baseline_sampling/sample.id.csv). 

Ariana also created a [fragment tracking datasheet](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv) and  [baseline sampling checklist](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/baseline_sampling/baseline_sampling_checklist.csv) that will be used to track sampling and metadata for this project.  

Two tube boxes were labeled as well with one box for RNA DNA shield samples (Tubes 1-48) and snap frozen samples (Tubes 49-96).  

Finally, n=24 whirlpacks were labeled with fragment number as well as project information ("E5 Apul metabolism; Oct 2022 baseline; Putnam").

### *Daily measurements*  

Ariana took daily measurements of the adult corals. The protocol for daily measurements [can be found here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-24-Moorea-Daily-Measurement-Protocol.md).  

The daily probe set up looks like the photo below. We take measurements of water flow, temperature (C), pH (mV), conductivity (psu), and light (PAR). Daily measurements except for light (see below) are taken at the center of each tank simultaneously.  

![probes](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/dailyprobes.jpeg)

Light is taken in the following locations in each tank:  

![light locations](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/lightquads.png)  

Daily measurements for today were recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements).    

All tanks and fragments looked good today and no mortality was observed. Ariana is going to start making materials to replace the paperclips with coated wire. After about 1 week they will be rusting.   

# 28 September 2022 

### *Cleaning tanks*  

The team cleaned all large blue tanks today. Due to a clog in the line, water flow was cut off to one blue tank earlier this week resulting in some coral mortality. Dead portions of colonies were cut off of colonies and removed from tanks. All tanks were scrubbed and cleaned and filled with new water. Colonies will be taken back to the reef on Friday now that E5 fragmentation is complete (see below).  

### *E5 adult coral metabolism experiment*  

Ariana cleaned all tanks, cleaned all fragments, secured clips to wire hangers, and finished labeling and fragmenting corals. Danielle assisted with fragmentation and labeling. These are described in more detail below.  

Ariana has also started documents for [entering data while tracking daily environmental measurements](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements), [conducting daily measurements and weekly cleanings](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/schedule.xlsx), and tracking fragment survival in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv). Ariana will write and post links to [protocols here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/protocols).   

#### *Fragmentation*  

Ariana finished fragmenting corals today for this project. There was high mortality of fragments for genotype C that was fragmented on 26 September 2022 (8 fragments showed mortality). Therefore, all C fragments were removed and replaced with a new genotype. This was also done for genotype A in which >80% of fragments showed signs of mortality. There was no other observed mortality in fragments from genotypes B, D, and E.  

New genotypes for A and C fragments and for F fragments were fragmented at 1600-1800. 35 fragments were obtained from each genotype and were fragmented as previously described below. Fragments were attached to labels and added to tanks by 2100. The fragments varied in size from 2 cm to 6 cm in length depending on the available fragments from the morphology of the parent colony.  

The final list of tank fragment locations is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv) and listed below.   

Tank 1: 

- A1-A5
- B1-B5
- C1-C6
- D1-D6
- E1-E6
- F1-F6

Tank 2: 

- A6-A11
- B6-B11
- C7-C11
- D7-D11
- E7-E12
- F7-F12

Tank 3: 

- A12-A17
- B12-B17
- C12-C17
- D12-D17
- E13-E17
- F13-F18

Tank 4: 

- A18-A23
- B18-B23
- C18-C23
- D18-D23
- E18-E23
- F19-F24

Tank 5: 

- A24-A29

- A30-A35
- B30-B35
- C30-C35
- D30-D35
- E30-E35
- F30-F35  

In the case that another genotype experiences mortality, there are 2 extra genotypes that were fragmented and will be held in the water tables.  

![extras](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/extrafrags.jpeg)  

#### *Cleaning and tank set up*  

Ariana cleaned all treatment tanks by removing fragments and placing them in the water table with running water. Tanks were wiped clean and rinsed and re filled. Strings on fragments were cleaned to remove algae.  

Ariana made notches in the hanging wires to prevent clips from moving around and the corals from getting too close to each other. These have worked well today.   

In the next week, we will switch the paper clips to plastic clips to prevent rusting.

#### *Feeding treatments*  

In 27 September 2022 post, Ariana described potential feeding treatments using artificial food. Ariana measured tank dimensions today for the E5 project  - 40 cm W x 55 cm L x 30 cm H = ~66 liters. This is equivalent to about 18 gallons.  

[Reef Chili](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/brs-reef-chili-coral-food.html#:~:text=Reef%20Chili%20has%20been%20tested,and%20colorful%20in%20one%20food.): Manufacturer recommends 1 scoop per 20 gallons. We would use 1 scoop per feeding per tank = 4 scoops per feeding total. If we assume 1 scoop = 1 gram, then we would have approx. 40 feedings per jar of reef chili (40 g per jar). If we feed 3x per week from mid-October to mid-December we will have 24 feedings. This will require One 1.4oz container has approximately 100 scoops. We should order 5 jars of reef chili to be safe. It can be stored in the fridge for up to a year if we do not use it. *It looks like this item is currently out of stock.*  

[Reef Roids](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/brs-reef-chili-coral-food.html#:~:text=Reef%20Chili%20has%20been%20tested,and%20colorful%20in%20one%20food.): Manufacturer recommends 1 teaspoon per 100 gallons. We would therefore use 0.2 teaspoons per tank x 4 tanks = 0.8 teaspoons per feeding. With a total of 24 feedings, we would need ~20 teaspoons of Reef Roids. The bags are sold in units of 75 g or 150 g. On the website, it says "On average, the 30-gram bag of Reef-Roids will last roughly three months in a typical 50-gallon reef tank with bi-weekly feeding.". If we calculate this out, bi weekly feeding of a 50 gallon tank for 3 months would use 0.5 teaspoons per feeding x 2 feedings x 12 weeks = 12 teaspoons in a 30 gram bag. If we need 20 teaspoons minimum, we would need to order the 75 g bag. To have extra, we should order the 150 g size. It can be refrigerated to last longer if we do not use it.

### *Fragmentation*  

Ariana fragmented two more genotypes for use in the E5 adult experiment as described on 26 September 2022. Genotypes fragmented today were labeled D1-D35 and E1-E35. Fragments from colony A were showing mortality. These were removed from the tanks and will be replaced with a different genotype tomorrow. Fragmentation was completed from 0700-0900. Ariana and Danielle created labels in preparation for the final fragmentation tomorrow.  

Fragments were then allocated to tanks with tank number recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/metadata/fragments.csv). 

Fragments from yesterday appear to be healthy and the tank system is working well. In about a week we will need to change the paperclips to plastic coated paperclips to avoid rusting.  

Once fragmentation is completed, Ariana will start daily measurements of environmental conditions, regular tank cleaning, and final treatment preparations.  

The experimental design has been finalized for this project as is as follows:  

![e5design](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/e5design4.png)

This updated design includes a final processing for all fragments that includes the following responses: 
 
1. All fragments (5 per colony/genotype per tank) undergo CBASS testing at 5 temperatures including 27C, 29C, 31C, 32C, 33C (or something similar). 
2. We will take molecular samples from all fragments after CBASS. 
3. The fragment at the control temperature will then be used for molecular, metabolomic, and physiology responses.  

#### *Feeding treatments*  

For this experimental design, we need to plan for the type and amount of food to feed for Hollie to bring when she arrives in Moorea. Ariana looked in the literature for information on the effect of artificial foods (freeze dried plankton, rotifers, etc.) on coral growth.  

[Conlan et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6261599/): This paper compared coral growth with different types of food in *A. millepora* and *P. acuta*. They found no significant effect of feeding artificial foods on growth when compared to raw seawater. The dosage used was 0.05 g per tank in 49 L tanks. This equals about 1 mg per litre water.  

[Forsman et al. 2012](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/abs/coral-farming-effects-of-light-water-motion-and-artificial-foods/BC8845A6BF25F08A37D398A0137C4AEF): This paper examined the effects of different aritifical foods and dosage of foods on growth in *M. capitata*, *P. acuta*, and *P. compressa*. They tested 1X, 3X, and 10X of manufacturer's dosage of Reef Roids, Reef Chili, and several other brands of food. Specifically, in *M. capitata* (in the Acroporidae family) has positive growth responses to artificial foods. They found that dosage of 1X of manufacturer's instructions of Reef Roids or Reef Chili were best for this species. It is important not to overfeed, as this can reduce growth and cause tank algal overgrowth.  

For feeding in this experiment, Ariana suggests that we purchase either Reef Roids or Reef Chili. We can feed corals 3X per week in treatment tanks. Water can be turned off for 1 h during feeding. Ariana will look into the amount of food that will be required for this feeding. If the amount is too high, we can look into building a feeding tank for all corals to be fed as a group and thereby reduce the amount of food needed. 

#### *Remaining to-do items for experiment set up*  

- Prepare a tank for 3x week feedings  
- Remake paper clips to plastic clips 
- Create a schedule document for daily measurements and weekly cleaning check offs  
- Start treatment after ~ 2-week recovery period  
- Order coral food  

# 26 September 2022  

### *Logger deployment*  

Ariana deployed pendant loggers for the E5 adult project. The following loggers were deployed. Tanks were numbered as 1-6 for simplicity.   

| SSN     | Interval | Time in Tanks | Tank |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| 21335989 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 1 |
| 21002980 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 2 |
| 21002972 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 3 |
| 21335984 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 4 |
| 20937873 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 5 |
| 21002976 | 10 min |     1115 |     Tank 6 |
| 20444033 | 10 min |     1115 |     Wild parent tank 1 |
| 20719656 | 10 min |     1115 |     Wild parent tank 2 |

### *Fragmentation*  

Today the team started the process of fragmenting adult *A. pulchra* corals for the E5 project to investigate the effects of altered metabolic state on epigenetic state and thermal performance.  

To fragment, the team made and labeled strings (fishing line) attached to paper clips with lab tape as a label on the paper clip. These were then tied to coral fragments on the upper part of the branch such that the branch was oriented up right. The fragments were then clipped onto the wire using the paper clips.  Fragments were suspended 15-18 cm below the water surface.    

Coral fragments (~4-8 cm) were cut using bone clippers from larger colonies. Fragmentation was done in a water table from 1100-1900.    

![frags](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/frags.jpeg)
 
All treatment tanks were cleaned and pumps were added into each tank. Hobo pendant loggers are on the bottom center of each tank. Flow is high for these tanks to help corals recover from fragmentation. Note that no treatments have started yet, after fragmentation there will be a recovery period.  

![tanks 1](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/frags_tank1.jpeg)

![tanks 2](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/frags_tank3.jpeg)

Fragments were then allocated to tanks with tank number recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/metadata/fragments.csv). Each tank has 5-6 fragments per colony and will have equal numbers of fragments.  

A total of 3 genotypes/colonies were fragmented today and the team pre-labelled strings and paperclips for tomorrow. Ariana will finish fragmenting tomorrow and baseline sampling wll take place on Thurs/Friday of this week. 

*Fragmented today:*  

Colony A: Fragments A1-A35  
Colony B: Fragments B1-B35   
Colony C: Fragments C1-C25  

Note that A fragments have some mortality. Ariana may switch out colony A for a different colony tomorrow. Water quality and flow was poor in this tank today that may have led to some of the mortality.  

Tomorrow we will fragment colonies D, E, F.    

*Tank assignments*  

The tanks for each fragment are listed below and recorded in GitHub (see link above).  

Tank 1: 
- A1-5
- B1-5
- C1-6

Tank 2: 
- A6-11
- B6-11
- C7-11

Tank 3:  
- A12-17
- B12-17
- C12-17

Tank 4:  
- A18-23
- B18-23
- C18-23

Tank 5:  
- A24-29
- B24-29
- C24-29

Tank 6:  
- A30-35  
- B30-35
- C30-35  

### *Revised E5 design*  

Given the amount of space in each tank and the number of fragments we could get per colony, Ariana re calculated our E5 design numbers. The changes are:  

- Removing mid November time point. Since we want to know about how metabolic state influences stress response, it makes the most sense to keep our replication/samples for the time point in which we plan to do CBASS. 
- Changed treatments to include autotrophy (light, no food), auto/hetero (light, added food), and heterotrophy (shaded, no food) as suggested by R. Cunning. This will provide nutritional treatments to shift metabolic state. Given our current design, we can do n=2 tanks per treatment.  
- tanks will now include 5-6 fragments per colony. This will provide enough samples to take baseline samples this week as well as have 1 fragment for physiology and molecular and 3-4 fragments for CBASS. We can destructively sample following CBASS. The temperatures for CBASS will be chosen to represent a control, moderate heating, and high heating tempratures.  
- Colony number has been reduced from 10 down to 6. There is not enough room in the tanks for all 10 colonies.

# 25 September 2022  

### *Logger calibration*  

Ariana removed loggers from tanks at 1030 and downloaded all logger files at 1200 and began writing a script to calulate the offsets for each logger.  

### *Tank set up*  

Ariana set up the E5 tanks to have hanging wires for each fragment when fragmentation occurs tomorrow.  

![tanks 1](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/e5_tank1.jpeg)

![tanks 2](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2022/e5_tank2.jpeg)

### *Planning for tomorrow*  

Tomorrow Ariana will fragment the *A. pulchra* corals. These are the steps we will follow to fragment:  

1. Select corals with the most fragments/branches (n=10 preferred).  
2. Place the first colony in a holding tank on the water table.  
3. Use bone cutters and a frag saw to cut as many fragments as possible approx. 3-4 in long at the branches.  
4. Label the fragments by attaching to a paperclip with a tape label using fishing line. Label with a colony letter and number (e.g., A1-A30, B1-B30, etc.).  
5. Place the fragments in the tanks randomly distrubted between the tanks.  
6. Return the remaining colony to the holding tank.  

This fragmentation will be followed by baseline sampling at the start of the treatment period depending on the number of fragments available.  

# 24 September 2022  

### *Logger calibration*  

Ariana added the two pendant loggers from the incubators into the calibration tank that were missed yesterday.  

Logger 21335989 - logging every 10 min  
Logger 21002976 - logging every 10 min  

Added to calibration tank at 0900. Note that data from 0700-0830 may need to be removed from the calibration. At this time the morning sun is causing shadows in the tank that may make the calibration in accurate.  

### *Daily measurement probe set up*  

Daily measurements for larval and the E5 adult project should include:  

1. **Flow rate (mL / 10 sec)**: Use a graduated clyinder to measure the amount of water from the input tube in a 10 sec period.    
2. **Temperature (C)**: Measurement of temperature in the center of each tank.   
3. **Light (PAR)**: Measurement of light at the center of the tank and in the center of each of 4 quadrants (total of 5 measurements per tank).    
4. **pH and salinity**: Measure pH and salinity with the Orion probe at the center of each tank.  

Time of day, tank number, and notes regarding weather or other conditions should be noted.  

For Ariana's larval project, daily measurements will be recorded in [Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1wYqONrAvGfsWG7UNqLmtOYiIFESSJR6olzfFf_IhgYg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110285914417149495351).   

For the E5 adult project, daily pH, temperature, and flow measurements will be recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements/daily_pH_temp_flow.xlsx) and daily light measurements will be recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements/daily_light.xlsx).  

The protocol for taking daily measurements was written by Ariana available here in the [E5 protocols repository](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-24-Moorea-Daily-Measurement-Protocol.md) based on the [Putnam Lab protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols.md#II-Tris-Calibration).  

Ariana prepared all probes and measured a standard curve for the pH probe across a range of temperature with Tris using the [Putnam Lab protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols.md#II-Tris-Calibration). 15 mL of Tris was added to a falcon tube and placed in the fridge for ~20 min. The temperature and pH probe were then submerged into the falcon tube on the bench top. The calibration started at 11°C and slowly warmed to room temperature with measurements of temperature and Tris every ~1°C. Once the Tris reached room temperature the Tris and probes were moved into a benchtop incubator (MyTemp Mini) and warmed to the upper temperature used in the calibration (~35C).   

This data is below and was recorded in Ariana's [Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYqONrAvGfsWG7UNqLmtOYiIFESSJR6olzfFf_IhgYg/edit#gid=1109057105) and in the [E5 repository here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/20220924_Tris_Calibration.csv).

# 23 September 2022  

### *Project set up*  

Ariana cleaned water lines and started water in n=6 tanks in preparation for the adult experiment.  

Ariana started a [GitHub repo for this project here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism).  

### *Logger offload and calibration*  

Loggers were read off for the wildtype parent tanks and Danielle's parent tanks. Files were labeled with SSN and date and saved in the Apulchra_metabolism E5  GitHub repository. Loggers read off were: 

20719656 (Wildtype Tank 2)  
20946644 (Danielle Tank 1)    
20444033 (Wildtype Tank 1)   
20444040 (Danielle Tank 2)  

The wildtype colonies are those that will be fragmented and used for this experiment.  

Ariana started a calibration of all temperature and light loggers that will run over the next 24-48 h. This will allow us to convert Lux to PAR from the Hobo Pendant loggers and to calculate temperature offsets from the temperature logging on the Hobo Pendants.  

The following loggers were launched:  

| Logger   | Interval | Type          | Time Deployed  |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 20719656 | 10 min   | Hobo Temp     | 1635           |

| 15643    | 10 min   | Odyssey Light | 1635           


The Odyssey logger was previously calibrated by Danielle Becker-Polinski [with this protocol](https://daniellembecker.github.io/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/Odyssey-PAR-Loggers-Protocol/).  

Loggers were arranged as pictured below in one tank with running water at a low flow to avoid surface disturbance. These loggers will run for 24-48 h to conduct the calibration for light and temperature data.

# 22 September 2022  

### *Project set up*

Ariana constructed tanks from the 6 plastic bins that were purchased yesterday for the experiment. Holes were drilled in the top edges of the bins for wires to be secured to hang coral fragments and a drain hole was added.  

Tomorrow, Ariana will add water flow to these tanks and prepare materials for sampling and fragmentation over the weekend.  

# 21 September 2022  

### *Project planning*

Ariana discussed experimental design with the E5 team and we have revised the experimental approach as pictured below.  

![E5 project2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/E5project2.png) 

This revision includes these updates:  

- Moving sampling time points from 3 (Oct, Nov, Dec) to two time points (Nov and Dec) to maximize the number of fragments per colony needed with available material.  
- Added biopsy for ITS2 and 16S sequencing during sampling.  
- Increase number of genotypes/colonies to n=10
- We will now need n=3 fragments per colony per tank in order to sample one fragment per colony at each time point. We will try to obtain n=3-5 fragments per colony per tank in the case that we want to increase sampling for CBASS and having an extra fragment in case of mortality.  

We will continue to talk with the E5 team to finalize the design prior to fragmenting and starting the experiment early next week.  

### *Project set up*    

Ariana, Pierrick, and Danielle sourced materials for the E5 adult project including buying tank bins, finding shade cloth, and cleaning water tables. We have black shade cloth with rebar on either side that fit on our tank systems. We purchased 6 plastic bins that will be used as tanks. We cleaned water tables to prepare space for these tanks. 

Ariana measured light levels under ambient conditions (under covered tank area with no shade cloth) and under two low light conditions (1 layer of shade cloth and 2 layers of shade cloth). Light levels in the high light treatment will be 500-700 PAR peaking during the day. Under one layer of shade cloth, light was reduced by 65% to approx. 100-300 PAR. Under two layers of shade cloth, light was reduced 80% to <100 PAR. We will use one layer of shade cloth for this experiment to provide sufficient light for coral growth in both treatments.  

We found recirculating pumps for each tank. We also prepared equipment for hanging the fragments. We will drill holes across the length of each tank to secure wire. We will then use paper clips to secure fragments tied to fishing line to hang fragments in the tank. This will help reduce algal growth and will be more efficient to set up and maintain.  

Ariana will finish set up for this project this week and then move forward with fragging and starting the experiment once design is finalized.   

### *Boating*  

Danielle gave the team an orientation to driving the LTER boat (509) at Gump. Ariana took 4 trips as captain driving in the channels to learn navigation on the north shore. Ariana and Pierrick will work on obtaining their authorization for driving Gump boats.

# 20 September 2022  

### *Project planning*  

Ariana developed a draft experimental design for the adult coral E5 repeat stressor experiment. Ariana conducted planning and sourcing materials for this project today. 

Overall, this project will expose coral colonies to ambient (450-600 PAR) and reduced (100-200 PAR) light conditions. A draft design is included below. This experiment will run until December. Monthly, fragments will be sampled for molecular, metabolomic, and physiological metrics. In December, S. Matsuda and R. Cunning will measure thermal phenotypes using the CBASS system.

The parent colony collection and maintenance is described in our [daily entry notebook](). Parent colonies were collected from the Mahana site on Moorea's north shore (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W) on 16 September 2022.

![field site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/mahana.png)

We collected n=25 colonies (approx. 15-30cm in diameter) from large patches of *Acropora pulchra* from the Mahana field site between 1000-1200. We have a year-long project that has been tracking histology and physiology of colonies (Danielle's project) at this site and therefore we have temperature and light data from this site as environmental context. The colonies collected are considered "wildtype" and were not taken from tagged colonies. Colonies were collected from different patches to obtain a genetically diverse sample.

Ariana and Danielle used a hammer and chisel to remove large fragments (15-30cm diameter) from these patches. Ariana Danielle and Pierrick transported them back to the boat where they were kept in coolers and buckets filled with seawater. Colonies were then transported back to Gump station at 1230 and placed in 2 flow through seawater tanks (n=12-13 colonies per tank). Tanks are equipped with 3 small recirculating pumps for water flow and had high water flow.   

![parents tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/colonies_tank.jpeg)

These colonies were monitored for spawning in September but did not spawn.
