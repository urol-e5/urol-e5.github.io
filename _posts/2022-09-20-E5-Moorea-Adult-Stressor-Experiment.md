This post includes the full notebook for Sept-Dec 2022 *Acropora pulchra* adult coral experiment Moorea, French Polynesia. These notebook posts are updated in order of most recent to oldest.

# Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to expose adult *Acropora pulchra* corals to conditions that elicit changes in symbiotic and metabolic condition and test how these changes influence response to a repeat stressor. Here, we are manipulating light conditions to elicit metabolic and symbiotic responses and testing stress response at the end of the experiment using the thermal stress CBASS system. The team will expose adult corals to ambient and low light conditions in Sept - Dec with thermal stress phenotype measurement in Dec with S. Matsuda and R. Cunning.  

This post details activities and notebooks for this project.

### *Logger calibration*  

Ariana removed loggers from tanks at 1030 and downloaded all logger files at 1200 and began writing a script to calulate the offsets for each logger.  

### *Tank set up*  

Ariana set up the E5 tanks to have hanging wires for each fragment when fragmentation occurs tomorrow.

### *Planning for tomorrow*  

Tomorrow Ariana will fragment the *A. pulchra* corals. These are the steps we will follow to fragment:  

1. Select corals with the most fragments/branches (n=10 preferred).  
2. Place the first colony in a holding tank on the water table.  
3. Use bone cutters and a frag saw to cut as many fragments as possible approx. 3-4 in long at the branches.  
4. Label the fragments by attaching to a paperclip with a tape label using fishing line. Label with a colony letter and number (e.g., A1-A30, B1-B30, etc.).  
5. Place the fragments in the tanks randomly distrubted between the tanks.  
6. Return the remaining colony to the holding tank.  

This fragmentation will be followed by baseline sampling at the start of the treatment period depending on the number of fragments available.

### *Logger calibration*  

Ariana added the two pendant loggers from the incubators into the calibration tank that were missed yesterday.  

Logger 21335989 - logging every 10 min  
Logger 21002976 - logging every 10 min  

Added to calibration tank at 0900. Note that data from 0700-0830 may need to be removed from the calibration. At this time the morning sun is causing shadows in the tank that may make the calibration in accurate.  

### *Daily measurement probe set up*  

Daily measurements for larval and the E5 adult project should include:  

1. **Flow rate (mL / 10 sec)**: Use a graduated clyinder to measure the amount of water from the input tube in a 10 sec period.    
2. **Temperature (C)**: Measurement of temperature in the center of each tank.   
3. **Light (PAR)**: Measurement of light at the center of the tank and in the center of each of 4 quadrants (total of 5 measurements per tank).    
4. **pH and salinity**: Measure pH and salinity with the Orion probe at the center of each tank.  

Time of day, tank number, and notes regarding weather or other conditions should be noted.  

For Ariana's larval project, daily measurements will be recorded in [Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1wYqONrAvGfsWG7UNqLmtOYiIFESSJR6olzfFf_IhgYg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110285914417149495351).   

For the E5 adult project, daily pH, temperature, and flow measurements will be recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements/daily_pH_temp_flow.xlsx) and daily light measurements will be recorded in [GitHub here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/daily_measurements/daily_light.xlsx).  

The protocol for taking daily measurements was written by Ariana available here in the [E5 protocols repository](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-24-Moorea-Daily-Measurement-Protocol.md) based on the [Putnam Lab protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols.md#II-Tris-Calibration).  

Ariana prepared all probes and measured a standard curve for the pH probe across a range of temperature with Tris using the [Putnam Lab protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols.md#II-Tris-Calibration). 15 mL of Tris was added to a falcon tube and placed in the fridge for ~20 min. The temperature and pH probe were then submerged into the falcon tube on the bench top. The calibration started at 11°C and slowly warmed to room temperature with measurements of temperature and Tris every ~1°C. Once the Tris reached room temperature the Tris and probes were moved into a benchtop incubator (MyTemp Mini) and warmed to the upper temperature used in the calibration (~35C).   

This data is below and was recorded in Ariana's [Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYqONrAvGfsWG7UNqLmtOYiIFESSJR6olzfFf_IhgYg/edit#gid=1109057105) and in the [E5 repository here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/environmental/20220924_Tris_Calibration.csv).

### *Project set up*  

Ariana cleaned water lines and started water in n=6 tanks in preparation for the adult experiment.  

Ariana started a [GitHub repo for this project here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism).  

### *Logger offload and calibration*  

Loggers were read off for the wildtype parent tanks and Danielle's parent tanks. Files were labeled with SSN and date and saved in the Apulchra_metabolism E5  GitHub repository. Loggers read off were: 

20719656 (Wildtype Tank 2)  
20946644 (Danielle Tank 1)    
20444033 (Wildtype Tank 1)   
20444040 (Danielle Tank 2)  

The wildtype colonies are those that will be fragmented and used for this experiment.  

Ariana started a calibration of all temperature and light loggers that will run over the next 24-48 h. This will allow us to convert Lux to PAR from the Hobo Pendant loggers and to calculate temperature offsets from the temperature logging on the Hobo Pendants.  

The following loggers were launched:  

| Logger   | Interval | Type          | Time Deployed  |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 20719656 | 10 min   | Hobo Temp     | 1635           |

| 15643    | 10 min   | Odyssey Light | 1635           


The Odyssey logger was previously calibrated by Danielle Becker-Polinski [with this protocol](https://daniellembecker.github.io/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/Odyssey-PAR-Loggers-Protocol/).  

Loggers were arranged as pictured below in one tank with running water at a low flow to avoid surface disturbance. These loggers will run for 24-48 h to conduct the calibration for light and temperature data.

### *Project set up*

Ariana constructed tanks from the 6 plastic bins that were purchased yesterday for the experiment. Holes were drilled in the top edges of the bins for wires to be secured to hang coral fragments and a drain hole was added.  

Tomorrow, Ariana will add water flow to these tanks and prepare materials for sampling and fragmentation over the weekend.  

# 21 September 2022  

### *Project planning*

Ariana discussed experimental design with the E5 team and we have revised the experimental approach as pictured below.  

![E5 project2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/E5project2.png) 

This revision includes these updates:  

- Moving sampling time points from 3 (Oct, Nov, Dec) to two time points (Nov and Dec) to maximize the number of fragments per colony needed with available material.  
- Added biopsy for ITS2 and 16S sequencing during sampling.  
- Increase number of genotypes/colonies to n=10
- We will now need n=3 fragments per colony per tank in order to sample one fragment per colony at each time point. We will try to obtain n=3-5 fragments per colony per tank in the case that we want to increase sampling for CBASS and having an extra fragment in case of mortality.  

We will continue to talk with the E5 team to finalize the design prior to fragmenting and starting the experiment early next week.  

### *Project set up*    

Ariana, Pierrick, and Danielle sourced materials for the E5 adult project including buying tank bins, finding shade cloth, and cleaning water tables. We have black shade cloth with rebar on either side that fit on our tank systems. We purchased 6 plastic bins that will be used as tanks. We cleaned water tables to prepare space for these tanks. 

Ariana measured light levels under ambient conditions (under covered tank area with no shade cloth) and under two low light conditions (1 layer of shade cloth and 2 layers of shade cloth). Light levels in the high light treatment will be 500-700 PAR peaking during the day. Under one layer of shade cloth, light was reduced by 65% to approx. 100-300 PAR. Under two layers of shade cloth, light was reduced 80% to <100 PAR. We will use one layer of shade cloth for this experiment to provide sufficient light for coral growth in both treatments.  

We found recirculating pumps for each tank. We also prepared equipment for hanging the fragments. We will drill holes across the length of each tank to secure wire. We will then use paper clips to secure fragments tied to fishing line to hang fragments in the tank. This will help reduce algal growth and will be more efficient to set up and maintain.  

Ariana will finish set up for this project this week and then move forward with fragging and starting the experiment once design is finalized.   

### *Boating*  

Danielle gave the team an orientation to driving the LTER boat (509) at Gump. Ariana took 4 trips as captain driving in the channels to learn navigation on the north shore. Ariana and Pierrick will work on obtaining their authorization for driving Gump boats.

# 20 September 2022  

### *Project planning*  

Ariana developed a draft experimental design for the adult coral E5 repeat stressor experiment. Ariana conducted planning and sourcing materials for this project today. 

Overall, this project will expose coral colonies to ambient (450-600 PAR) and reduced (100-200 PAR) light conditions. A draft design is included below. This experiment will run until December. Monthly, fragments will be sampled for molecular, metabolomic, and physiological metrics. In December, S. Matsuda and R. Cunning will measure thermal phenotypes using the CBASS system.  

![E5 project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/E5project.png) 

The parent colony collection and maintenance is described in our [daily entry notebook](). Parent colonies were collected from the Mahana site on Moorea's north shore (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W) on 16 September 2022.

![field site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/mahana.png)

We collected n=25 colonies (approx. 15-30cm in diameter) from large patches of *Acropora pulchra* from the Mahana field site between 1000-1200. We have a year-long project that has been tracking histology and physiology of colonies (Danielle's project) at this site and therefore we have temperature and light data from this site as environmental context. The colonies collected are considered "wildtype" and were not taken from tagged colonies. Colonies were collected from different patches to obtain a genetically diverse sample.

Ariana and Danielle used a hammer and chisel to remove large fragments (15-30cm diameter) from these patches. Ariana Danielle and Pierrick transported them back to the boat where they were kept in coolers and buckets filled with seawater. Colonies were then transported back to Gump station at 1230 and placed in 2 flow through seawater tanks (n=12-13 colonies per tank). Tanks are equipped with 3 small recirculating pumps for water flow and had high water flow.   

![parents tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/colonies_tank.jpeg)

These colonies were monitored for spawning in September but did not spawn.
