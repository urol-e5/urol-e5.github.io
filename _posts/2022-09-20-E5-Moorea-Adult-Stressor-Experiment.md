This post includes the full notebook for Sept-Dec 2022 *Acropora pulchra* adult coral experiment Moorea, French Polynesia. These notebook posts are updated in order of most recent to oldest.

# Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to expose adult *Acropora pulchra* corals to conditions that elicit changes in symbiotic and metabolic condition and test how these changes influence response to a repeat stressor. Here, we are manipulating light conditions to elicit metabolic and symbiotic responses and testing stress response at the end of the experiment using the thermal stress CBASS system. The team will expose adult corals to ambient and low light conditions in Sept - Dec with thermal stress phenotype measurement in Dec with S. Matsuda and R. Cunning.  

This post details activities and notebooks for this project.

### *Project planning*  

Ariana developed a draft experimental design for the adult coral E5 repeat stressor experiment. Ariana conducted planning and sourcing materials for this project today. 

Overall, this project will expose coral colonies to ambient (450-600 PAR) and reduced (100-200 PAR) light conditions. A draft design is included below. This experiment will run until December. Monthly, fragments will be sampled for molecular, metabolomic, and physiological metrics. In December, S. Matsuda and R. Cunning will measure thermal phenotypes using the CBASS system.

The parent colony collection and maintenance is described in our [daily entry notebook]().  





Parent colonies were collected from the Mahana site on Moorea's north shore (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W).

We first collected n=24 *A. pulchra* experimental colonies for Danielle's project at 0800-0900 at the Mahana field site. We transported these colonies back to Gump station at 1000. Parental colonies had previously experienced a marine heatwave scenario or ambient diel conditions in March-April 2022. All information on the heatwave experiment and data can be found [here](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/heatwave).


We then collected n=25 colonies (approx. 15-30cm in diameter) from large patches of *Acropora pulchra* from the Mahana field site between 1000-1200. We have a year-long project that has been tracking histology and physiology of colonies (Danielle's project) at this site and therefore we have temperature and light data from this site as environmental context. The colonies collected are considered "wildtype" and were not taken from tagged colonies. Colonies were collected from different patches to obtain a genetically diverse sample.

Ariana and Danielle used a hammer and chisel to remove large fragments (15-30cm diameter) from these patches. Ariana Danielle and Pierrick transported them back to the boat where they were kept in coolers and buckets filled with seawater. Colonies were then transported back to Gump station at 1230 and placed in 2 flow through seawater tanks (n=12-13 colonies per tank). Tanks are equipped with 3 small recirculating pumps for water flow and had high water flow.

These colonies will be used to collect wildtype gametes to rear to larval stages for Ariana's project. Spawn will be collected from each of the 2 tanks with wildtype colonies.
