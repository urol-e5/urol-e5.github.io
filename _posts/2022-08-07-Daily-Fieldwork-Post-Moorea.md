### *Sediment sampling*

Drove to four sites (west side mangrove patch 1, west side mangrove patch 2, Public Beach, and Gump) to take sedimnet and water samples at each site (n=5) for a labmate who has collaborators interested in anaerobic protists that live in sandy, or muddy sediments in freshwater, marine, or brackish environments. Sandy or rocky beaches, 
mangroves and stinky mud are all great sampling locations. We used 50mL falcon tubes to collect ~20 mLs of sediment and then tightly sealed the tubes with parafilm for storage and transfer.

### *Imaging*

Janya took more photos from her iPad at Public Beach for her computer and citizen science coral imaging app project. 

### *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), the May, June, July *Acropora pulchra* timeseries and the *Pocillopora* TPC samples were weighed from the drying oven and put back into the muffle furnace for their last ash weight.
