## 18 March 2022

### *Heatwave Experiment Prep*
Danielle improved the tank chiller system and attached it to the 12 ambient tanks, set up six temperarture probes and the Apex outside for six of the hot tank treatment. Installed all pumps and took measurements while setting up the flow to all 24 tanks. 

### *Airbrushing*
Lauren [airbrushed](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) 20 *Pocillopora* samples from the March 2022 timepoint sampling from the backreef and forereef to determine physiological status using the [physiological protocols listed here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols).

### *Aliquoting*
After airburshing and freezing the samples in a -40 C freezer, samples were aliquoted following the aliquoting steps at the end of the [airbrushing](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) protocol for samples that will be used for [symbiont densities](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md), [chlorophyll content](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md), symbiont [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), host [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), and [tissue biomass](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md).

### *Surface area*
Surface area for all of the corals *Pocillopora* from January and February and Acropora from the March 2022 timepoint sampling were completed following the [surface area protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2021-02-17-Surface_Area_Protocol.md). All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries).
