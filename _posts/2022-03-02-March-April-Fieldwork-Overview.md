This post details all activities in Moorea in March and April 2022 for the Gametogenesis and Heatwave projects for the study species *Acropora pulchra* and *Pocillopora sp.*.  

# Overview  

A major Aim of the [E5 project](https://e5coral.org/) is to examine the effects of environmental stressors that shift the coral-microbe symbiosis on epigenetics, gene expression, and organismal physiology on carry over across generations, also known as trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, or parental effects.

We are conducting a field trip to Moorea in March and April 2022 with the goal to sample *Acropora pulchra* and *Pocillopora spp.* throughout gametogenesis on the northshore backreef and collect data on histology, physiology, and epigenomics. Original tagging and sampling of 40 *Acropora pulchra* colonies was completed by the Putnam Lab team (Hollie, Ariana, Pierrick, and Alex (CRIOBE)) in December 2021 and of *Pocillopora spp.* starting in January 2022. Monthly timepoint sampling will be carried out for this project until October 2022 for spawning in collaboration with CRIOBE. We will also be exposing additional *Acropora pulchra* colonies to an experimental marine heatwave scenario from mid-March till mid-April 2022. The corals exposed to this treatment will be outplanted back to their origin reef site after the experimental period and have six months to recover before being re-sampled in October 2022 for spawning. We will be processing physiological measurements (symbiont densities, chlorophyll content, total protein, surface area, respirometry, and tissue biomass) for collected and preserved samples, measuring bleaching score on *in situ* and experimental colonies, conduting our marine heatwave exposure, measuring respirometry over the heatwave period for experimental colonies, decalcifying histological samples, and collecting molecular and histological samples during our two month trip.

## 2 March 2022

We arrived early in the morning to Moorea and took the ferry to Gump. Upon arrival, we organized all our personal belongings, lab spaces, and equipment in the molecular and LTER front lab. The 24 tank system  has been running fish experiments and we will be setting up temperature control for 12 ambient and 12 heatwave tanks to maximise the number of corals available for future spawning.

In the afternoon, fresh on jetlag, we filled a large cooler with ice and drove to CRIOBE to met Alexandre Fellous and pick up our frozen January 2022 (n = 37) and February 2022 (n = 36) physiological samples collected and frozen by Alex. We brought multiple samples; molecular RNA/DNA shield biopsies (n = 73; ~0.5 - 1 cm),  snap frozen in LN2 biopsies (n = 73; ~0.5 - 1 cm); and frozen physiological fragments (n = 73; ~3 inches) back to Gump and stored the molecular samples in the biocode -40 C freezer and the physiological fragments in the molecular lab -40 C freezer. The histological samples (n = 2 per colony) preserved in 10% formalin are still in a CRIOBE 4 C fridge and will be picked up next week. All December 2021 samples except for histoloigcal fragments were transported to URI in December 2021.

### *Airbrushing*
[Airbrushed](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) all 73 corals collected in January and February 2022 to determine physiological status using the [physiological protocols listed here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols).

### *Tank brainstorming meeting*  

Discussed how to set up 12 marine heatwave treatment tanks and 12 ambient tanks with one genotype per treatment and with timepoint fragments (n = 6) with five timepoints and one extra fragment for mortality. Also discussed troubleshooting for temperature of ambient tanks and need for chillers, etc.  

### *Boating updates*  

To drive the boats at Gump or through the LTER, station guests need to complete a California boat training, 6 check out passenger trips and 6 captain trips before a final checkout with a lab technician or staff to be approved to drive the boats. Danielle is checked out for both the Gump and MCR LTER 509s and 389s per confirmation from Andy. She also has received and printed a hard copy of her California boating card and MCR LTER boating card.

### *Apex aqua-controller and energy bar units*  

We brought two [APEX aquabus bas units](https://www.neptunesystems.com/getstarted/apexng/) and [APEX 832 energy bars](https://www.neptunesystems.com/products/expansion-modules/energy-bars/) and 10 [APEX PM1 units](https://www.neoquarium.fr/fr/gestion-electronique-aquarium/138-neptune-system-pm1-module.html) to be able to control temperature profiles, heaters, and chillers for our tank set up. In order to use and set specific temperature fluctuations and diel cycles, you need to connect your APEX units to the online APEX fusion interface to be able to control all online functions and APEX controllers. In order to get up and running you can follow the comprehensive [APEX reference manual](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/ApexComprehensiveReferenceManual.1042767863/view) and [APEX getting started guide](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1533740/Neptune-Systems-Apexel.html).

### *Preliminary tank setup*  

To test if the light and ambient temperature conditions would be favorable for our tank system, HOBO light and temperature loggers, temp probes, heaters, Apex units, and pumps were set up in two XL tanks. One tank was ambient and the other was set to run a diel temperature fluctuation with a max temperature of 30 C. We also wanted to check that the Odyssey light loggers we had calibrated using a LICOR and following the [LICOR calibration protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/LICOR_logger_calibration.md) worked properly so two Odyssey light loggers were deployed in each tank as well. Odyssey light loggers were deployed following the [Odyssey quick start guide](http://odysseydatarecording.com/download/odyssey_quick_start_guide.pdf) set to run at 1 minute intervals starting 20220303 at 10:00am till battery exhaustion which would be on October 10th 2022. The HOBO light and temperature loggers were deployed using the [HOBOmobile](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/software/hobomobile/) app following the [HOBO® Pendant® MX Temp/Light (MX2202) Logger Manual](https://assets.omega.com/manuals/HOBO%20MX2201%20and%20MX2202%20Manual.pdf) set to log every 1 minute starting on 20220303 at 10:00am until I stopped them in a few days.

### *pH calibration*  
Calibrated our Orion pH/conductivity meter using a tris pH standard curve generation [general protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/20201110_CBLS_WaterQuality_Checklist.Md#pH_Tris_Calibration) and the conductivity [two-point calibration](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Orion_MultiParameter_Sensor_Protocol.md#Conductivity).

### *Tank fill Training*  

Kathryn taught Danielle and Lauren how to fill scuba tanks using the compressor available for use at Gump station. They have a video if anyone may need one in the future.

## 4 March 2022     


### *Hollie and Ariana meeting*
Discussed tank setup for heating and [chilling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/chiller%20setup1.jpg) and need for testing and troubleshooting to make sure we can have a consistent diel temperature cycle with the flow and available set up.

## 5 March 2022

### *Odyssey logger read out and field deployment*
[Odyssey PAR logger](http://odysseydatarecording.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=64&product_id=98)

Odyssey light loggers were taken out of the experimental tanks and read out following the instructions in the [Odyssey quick start guide](http://odysseydatarecording.com/download/odyssey_quick_start_guide.pdf).

![odyssey plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/March2022_Moorea/15640_001_hot_tank.JPG)

Following the instructions in the [Odyssey quick start guide](http://odysseydatarecording.com/download/odyssey_quick_start_guide.pdf) two light loggers were set to:

| Serial Number | Delay Start    | Site   | End Date                      | Location                              |
|---------------|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 15641         | 20220305 09:00 | Mahana | Last until: October 19th 2022 | Patch 04, next to HOBO 01 and Tag 457 |
| 15640         | 20220305 09:00 | Mahana | Last until: October 19th 2022 | Patch 04, next to HOBO 01 and Tag 457 |
|               |                |        |                               |                                       |

To reduce biofouling, the loggers were wrapped in copper tape at the top and wrapped with electrical tape and labeled.

### *Field day sampling for PI curves*

Lauren and I went to explore our Mahana site (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W) to find our patches and tags. After some searching we found them! We put out the light loggers next to patch 04 and collected five ~5 inch *Acropora pulchra* from the five patches to calculate our photosynthesis to irradiance curves (P-I curve). They are constructed from oxygen-respirometry techniques to assess the irradiance level at which photosynthesis becomes saturated (saturating irradiance, denoted as Ik) for corals at our sites. Irradiance levels that are higher or lower than Ik can reduce the organism’s efficiency to capture and utilize incoming light energy, so being able to identify what level is most conducive for the corals is important for future photosynthetic measurements.

### *PI curves*
Following the [PI curve Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-PI-Curve-Protocol.md), PI curves were conducted on five *Acropora pulchra* coral fragments that had been collected from the Mahana site from various patches used in our monthly sampling. We conduct PI curves to calculate various paramaters like Am (max photosynthetic rate), AQY (alpha), Rd (respiration), and Ik (saturating irradiance).

## 6 March 2022

### *Aliquoting*
After airburshing and freezing the samples in a -40 C freezer, samples were aliquoted following the aliquoting steps at the end of the [airbrushing](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) protocol for samples that will be used for [symbiont densities](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md), [chlorophyll content](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md), symbiont [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), host [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), and [tissue biomass](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md).


### *Surface area*
Surface area for all of the corals used in the PI curves (n = 5) and our samples from January and February (n = 73) were completed following the [surface area protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2021-02-17-Surface_Area_Protocol.md).

### *Equipment list from the Container*
Borrowing equipment from Burkepile container:
- 1 chiller - ARCTICA titanium chiller DBE 200
- 2 pumps - PONDMASTER fountain-mag - 190 GPH
- 4 extension cords -Belkin
- 9 150 Watt heaters - EHEIM JAGER

### *Hollie meeting*
Discussed setting up a chiller with a float valve to ensure the water does not ever go below the chiller or pumps. Having a chiller reservoir tote to supply a slow flow of chilled water to the tanks will be essential for the hotter days coming in April. Will use drawdown pvc fittings to facilitate a flow from chiller into every tank (n = 24).

### *Preliminary heatwave tank test - large tanks - six*

To test that our Apex energy bar and Apex aquabus unit could facilitate six consecutive heaters and outlets over our planned heatwave scenario, six large tanks were set up with one temp probe, one heater, and one pump per tank to run diel temperature cycles over the next week.
