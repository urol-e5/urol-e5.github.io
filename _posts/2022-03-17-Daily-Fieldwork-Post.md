## 17 March 2022

### *Heatwave Experiment Prep*
Danielle added valves to pipes for the 24 tank system, moved wet tables and powerwashed all pipes and area to set up the flow for the tanks and set up a closed chiller system. 

### *Airbrushing*
Lauren [airbrushed](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) 20 Pocillopora samples from the January and February 2022 collections from the backreef to determine physiological status using the [physiological protocols listed here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols).

### *Aliquoting*
After airburshing and freezing the samples in a -40 C freezer, samples were aliquoted following the aliquoting steps at the end of the [airbrushing](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md) protocol for samples that will be used for [symbiont densities](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md), [chlorophyll content](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md), symbiont [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), host [total protein](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), and [tissue biomass](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md).
