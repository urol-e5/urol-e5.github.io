### *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), all 310 pre-burned pans were weighed using an analytical balance with 0.00001 accuracy. The pre-burned pans were loaded with the symbiont and host tissue slurry from May, June, July *Acropora pulchra* timeseries and the *Pocillopora* TPC samples and placed into the drying oven so that they could reach a constant weight after 24 hours.

### *Symbiont counts*

Continued symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 40 corals collected in July 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries).
