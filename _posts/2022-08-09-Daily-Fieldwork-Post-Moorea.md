### *Histological processing*

Following the [histological processing protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2022-04-16-Histological-Processing.md) Danielle began the decalcification process on one replicate sample takem from the coral gametogenesis monthly sampling from May (n=40), June (n=40), and July (n=40).

### *Total protein*
Danielle completed the [total protein protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md) for May, June, July, and POC TPC holobiont samples. 

### *Symbiont counts*

Finished symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 40 corals collected in July 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries).
