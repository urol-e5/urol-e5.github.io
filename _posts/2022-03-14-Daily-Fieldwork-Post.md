### *Tank Updates*
Danielle and MVP Gump employee, Tony, have been working on getting a chiller system set-up for the water tables at Gump and today was the day! Using Hollies idea for a vanne Ã  flotteur system where the water can be cooled and used but will always stay above a certain level to not damage the pumps or the chiller. This set-up will be a great addition to control ambient temperature levels for the planned tank system.
