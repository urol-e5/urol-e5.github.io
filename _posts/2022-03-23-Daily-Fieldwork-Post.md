## 23 March 2022

### *Symbiont counts*
Lauren completed 18 symbiont counts from the March 2022 *Acropora pulchra* Gametogenesis timeseries sampling according to the [Cell Density Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-07-Cell-Density-Protocol.md)

### *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks at the end of the day.
