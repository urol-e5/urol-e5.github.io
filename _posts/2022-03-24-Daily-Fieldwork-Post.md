## 24 March 2022

## *Daily measurements*

Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks and offloaded the loggers at the end of the day. 

## *Apex*

Danielle calibrated the new Apex system and set up new temperature and outlets to go in the other six tanks for heated treatments. Additionally she added an air pump to the chiller tank.

## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed 18 symbiont counts from the March 2022 *Acropora pulchra* Gametogenesis timeseries sampling according to the [Cell Density Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-07-Cell-Density-Protocol.md)
