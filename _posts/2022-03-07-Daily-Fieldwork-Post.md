## 7 March 2022

### *Symbiont counts*

Lauren and I started symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 73 corals collected in January and February 2022.

### *PI curve calculations*

Following the [PI curve scripts parts 1, 2, and 3](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries/tree/master/timepoint_1/scripts) created by Ariana Huffmyer, we calculated Am (max photosynthetic rate), AQY (alpha), Rd (respiration), and Ik (saturating irradiance) for all five of the fragments.

Our Ik value was 645.2079.

### *CRIOBE samples and equipment*

We picked up the January and February 2022 histological samples that are preserved in 10% formalin from Alex at CRIOBE. We needed to re-label tubes and transfer the samples due to the fact that two pieces of fragments for February were in one tube since he ran out during last months sampling. We also picked up the dewer and ordered LN2 for our next sampling day and the rest of the field supplies (i.e. bleaching score ruler and field bags).
