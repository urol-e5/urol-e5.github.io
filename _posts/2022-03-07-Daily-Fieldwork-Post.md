## 7 March 2022

### *Symbiont counts*

Lauren and I started symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 73 corals collected in January and February 2022.

### *PI curve calculations*

Following the [PI curve scripts parts 1, 2, and 3](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries/tree/master/timepoint_1/scripts) created by Ariana Huffmyer, we calculated Am (max photosynthetic rate), AQY (alpha), Rd (respiration), and Ik (saturating irradiance) for all five of the fragments.
