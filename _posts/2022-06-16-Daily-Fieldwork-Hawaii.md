## 16 June 2022

### *Expedition Overview*  

The purpose of this field expedition is to conduct research during the spawning season for the coral *Montipora capitata* and the larval brooding season for *Pocillopora acuta* in Hawaii. Jill Ashey and Ariana Huffmyer (Putnam Lab, URI) and collaborators are conducting research at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in June - July 2022. Projects include characterization of the role of microRNA in coral development [see J. Ashey's notebook here](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and the timing of symbiotic nutritional exchange [see A. Huffmyer's notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/). 

### *Larval collection*  

There was more larval output today. It appears larval release may be ramping up. Larval release is still low, but increasing. 

Federica used larvae to set up settlement trials to test settlement on aragonite, ceramic, plastic, and waterproof paper substrates. 

Sarah used larvae to set up microscopes and cameras.       

### *Temperature treatments*   

The Apex was stable today! Jill and Federica set up pH probes for Federica's Apex system.  

### *Protocols*   

Today we went over respiration, isotopes, survival, settlement, and *Montipora capitata* spawning protocols. Protocols can be found in [Ariana's notebook](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/).
