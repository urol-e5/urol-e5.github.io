### *Symbiont counts*

Lauren and I continued symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 73 corals collected in January and February 2022.

### *Chlorophyll*

Danielle prepared the chlorophyll samples to be processed 2022-03-09 by adding 1mL of acetone to each sample and placing them in a dark fridge for 24 hours. Following the [Chlorophyll Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md).

### *Meetings with Hollie*

Danielle and Lauren met with Hollie together to discuss experimental design, logistics, and project progress. We both also met with Hollie indivdually to discuss individual progress.
