## 22 March 2022

## *Hanging coral fragments*

Danielle and I used fishing line to hang 6 coral fragments (TP 2-6, extra fragment from 24 colonies collected on March 19.

## *Daily measurements*

Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and completed daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks at the end of the day.

## *Hollie meeting*

Danielle met with Hollie to talk about survivorship data, bleaching score, and loggers.

## *Aliquot*

Lauren aliquoted 10 *Pocillopora* fragments collected in January 2022, 10 *Pocillopora* fragments collected in February 2022, and 24 *Acropora fragments* from TP1 into 1.5 mL tubes for symbiont counts, chlorophyll, and total protein.
