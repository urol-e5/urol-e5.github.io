## 18 August 2022

### *Final day in Mo'orea*

Conducted final packing and inventory for all lab spaces and storage units. Took the Terevau second to last ferry from Mo'orea to Tahiti for our 21:00 flight to SFO and then to BOS.

### *Completed this trip*

All physiological parameters for May, June, July, and August 2022 and for *Pocillopora* TPC were finished (Chlorophyll, symbiont densities, total protein, AFDW, and surface area). We also completed all of the decalcifying histological sampling for all months up until August 2022 and brought back samples with CITES. All inventory and CITES samples are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sgGuX6GCzzPdT06Gl70jYrfbIwLqKXhN7VtrNLGbqak/edit#gid=1187370841) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JAC9DE3Co10-FSNmLF7CrIAVKgGDqjx77uERl1C8cFc/edit#gid=452056180).
