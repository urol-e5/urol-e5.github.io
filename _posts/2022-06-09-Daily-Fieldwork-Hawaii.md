## 9 June 2022

### *Expedition Overview*  

The purpose of this field expedition is to conduct research during the spawning season for the coral *Montipora capitata* and the larval brooding season for *Pocillopora acuta* in Hawaii. Jill Ashey and Ariana Huffmyer (Putnam Lab, URI) and collaborators are conducting research at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in June - July 2022. Projects include characterization of the role of microRNA in coral development [see J. Ashey's notebook here](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and the timing of symbiotic nutritional exchange [see A. Huffmyer's notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/). 

### *Laboratory Setup* 

Jill cleaned squaricals and reglued seals on squaricals and banjo filters. Jill also deployed light/temperature Hobo loggers in three of the large tanks. Ariana picked up liquid nitrogen at UH main campus using a dewar from the [Coral Resilience Lab](https://www.coralresiliencelab.com). 

### *Logistics*

Ariana picked Federica (PhD candidate, Dr. Mass lab at University of Haifa) up at the airport. Federica will be working on pH effects on *M. capitata* larvae. 

There were some issues with shipping delays, but packages finally arrived from URI! All packages were moved into the indoor lab space and unpacked. Equipment and materials were inventoried and organized. Ariana also went to Lowe's to pick up some materials for the tanks. Additionally, the CO2 tank that will be used in Federica's experiments was delivered to the tank system today.

Tomorrow, Ariana, Jill & Federica will work on assembling cooler and Apex systems and preparing equipment (shade cloths, drain guards, banjo filters).
