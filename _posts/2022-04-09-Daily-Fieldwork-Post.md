## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed 10 symbiont counts for TP3. This data can be found in the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CnIWPQPw6XGmA1d3lQsuaW8gggBn5INB). She also cleaned tanks with Danielle and fed the feeding experiment corals for 30 minutes starting at 17:30.
