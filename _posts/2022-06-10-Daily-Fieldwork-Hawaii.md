## 10 June 2022

### *Expedition Overview*  

The purpose of this field expedition is to conduct research during the spawning season for the coral *Montipora capitata* and the larval brooding season for *Pocillopora acuta* in Hawaii. Jill Ashey and Ariana Huffmyer (Putnam Lab, URI) and collaborators are conducting research at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in June - July 2022. Projects include characterization of the role of microRNA in coral development [see J. Ashey's notebook here](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and the timing of symbiotic nutritional exchange [see A. Huffmyer's notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/). 

### *Tank and experimental setup*  

We made a lot of progress today setting up tank systems for this summer's experiments. 

- Jill made more banjo screens for the squaricals.

- Ariana assembled the cooler header systems that will be used to deliver heated and ambient seawater to the larval rearing containers. 

- Ariana assembled, cleaned, and ran all tank and squarical systems.

- Ariana & Jill deployed Hobo temperature/light loggers into the four blue tanks and one header tank at 21:45 HST.

### *Connecting Apex equipment*  

We started and connected the Apex system to WiFi for temperature and pH control. This process required a lot of troubleshooting, and below are the steps that were successful.  

- Jill collected Apex materials for temperature treatments. Ariana & Jill turned the Apex on and connected it to wifi and the Apex Fusion app.
- Plugged Apex brain into ethernet cable and went through set-up stages on phone with the Apex app
- Confirmed Apex was showing up on Fusion and unplugged ethernet cable
- On the computer, joined Apex set-up wifi
- Opened Safari and went to apex.local
- Selected the home wifi network (Gilligan for HIMB 2022) from the list that appeared
- Entered the password for the home wifi network
- Apex connected to wifi - a screen ran for ~10 minutes with the message "connecting to wifi"
- On the computer, disconnected from apex wifi and rejoined home wifi network
- Opened Apex fusion to check that the Apex was there and responsive (tested this by turning the outlets on/off using the fusion app)

This successfully connected the Apex system to WiFi. Tomorrow we will set up and program the Apex system to start temperature treatments. 

### *Collecting corals*  

Tomorrow we will collect 15-20 adult *Pocillopora acuta* colonies to monitor for larval release.
