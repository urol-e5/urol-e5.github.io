## 21 March 2022


### *Airbrushing*
Lauren airbrushed 10 *Pocillopora* fragments collected in January, 10 *Pocillopora* fragments collected in Februrary and 24 *Acropora pulchra* fragments from TP 1 in preparation for physiological assays: symbiont density, chlorophyll content, and total soluble protein content.

### *Colonies moved to tanks*
Danielle and Lauren transported the colonies from the blue bins into the tanks in the outdoor tank system. Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the colonies and completed daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH.

Tony and Danielle also cleaned and moved the pump earlier in this day.
