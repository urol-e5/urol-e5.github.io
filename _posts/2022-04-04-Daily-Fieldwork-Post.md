## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the fourth day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.3 °C to 30.0 °C. 

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), Danielle weighed the final ashed weight for the rest of heatwave TP1 and TP2 and put them into the muffle furnace. FINALLY DONE WITH PROCESSING :)

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
