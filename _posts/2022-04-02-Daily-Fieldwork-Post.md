## 02 April 2022

## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the second day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.1 °C to 29.8 °C.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), Danielle weighed the drying oven January, March, April, and some of heatwave TP1 pans and put them back into the muffle furnace for their last ash weight. She then weighed the pre-burned pans for the rest of heatwave TP1 and TP2 and loaded the symbiont and host tissue slurry into the pans and placed them in the drying oven to reach a constant weight after > 24 hours.

## *Aliquoting*

Lauren aliquoted all samples from TP3.

## *Surface Area*

Lauren followed the [surface area protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-02-17-Surface-Area-Protocol.md) and recorded surface area measurements for all TP3 samples.

## *Chlorophyll*

Lauren also quantified chlorophyll for TP3 following the [chlorophyll concentration protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md)

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments, as well as chlorophyll and  surface area measurements can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
