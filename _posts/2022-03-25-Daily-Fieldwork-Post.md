## 25 March 2022

## *Daily measurements*

Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks and set up for respirometry at the end of the day.

## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed the remaining 4 symbiont counts from the March 2022 *Acropora pulchra* Gametogenesis timeseries sampling according to the [Cell Density Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-07-Cell-Density-Protocol.md).

## *Surface Area*

After completing the symbiont counts, Lauren followed the [Surface Area Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-02-17-Surface-Area-Protocol.md) for 10 *Pocillopora* samples collected in January, 10 *Pocillopora* samples collected in February, and *Acropora pulchra* samples from TP1.

## *Chlorophyll preparation*

To prepare for the chlorophyll assay and [protocol](, Lauren pipetted 1mL of acetone into all chlorophyll tubes, then vortexed each tube for 15 seconds.

## *Data tracking*

All *Acropora pulchra* metadata and tracking were uploaded to the [gametogenesis timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries) and the *Acropora* sampling [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YSVr335RNhZXcJyI0TOSr_edmDsTy4zw).

All *Pocillopora* spp. metadata and tracking were uploaded to the [Mo'orea_Pocillopora GitHub](https://github.com/hputnam/Moorea_Pocillopora) and the *Pocillopora* sampling [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1w3KdwBZaaAFh8UdbOXM3KZCofldOC53i).
