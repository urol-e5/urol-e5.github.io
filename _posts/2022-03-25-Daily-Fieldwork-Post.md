## 25 March 2022

## *Daily measurements*

Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks and set up for respirometry at the end of the day.

## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed the remaining 4 symbiont counts from the March 2022 *Acropora pulchra* Gametogenesis timeseries sampling according to the [Cell Density Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-07-Cell-Density-Protocol.md).

## *Surface Area*

After completing the symbiont counts, Lauren followed the [Surface Area Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-02-17-Surface-Area-Protocol.md) for 10 *Pocillopora* samples collected in January, 10 *Pocillopora* samples collected in February, and *Acropora pulchra* samples from TP1.

## *Chlorophyll preparation*

To prepare for the chlorophyll assay, Lauren pipetted 1mL of acetone into all chlorophyll tubes, then vortexed each tube for 15 seconds.
