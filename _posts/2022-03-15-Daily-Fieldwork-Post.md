## 15 March 2022

### *March 2022 Field Day Sampling - Backreef Acropora and Pocillopora*
Danielle, Alex, and I returned to the Mahana site (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W) for monthly sampling. Following the [Field Sampling Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Field-Sampling-Protocol.md), we collected 40 ~5 inch *Acropora pulchra* fragments from the five patches located on the site.  Additionally, 10 4-5 inch fragments of *Pocillopora* were collected and brought back to Gump Station as well for same day processing. For all sampling locations, a close up photo with the tag was taken. Additionally, a bleaching score photo was taken at each sampling location. If a tag was not found, we sampled from the same colony that the tag should have been located on.

### *Same Day Processing*
After collecting the samples, Danielle and I followed the [Same Day Sample Processing Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Sample_Same_Day_Processing_Protocol.md) to prepare samples for histological analysis, molecular and physiological downstream processing.

### Bleaching Score Photos
All bleaching score photos were downloaded off of the Putnam Lab [Canon G7X ](https://www.fnac.com/Compact-Canon-PowerShot-G7X-Mark-II/a9570061/w-4) camera number 2 and uploaded to [Pocillopora_Sampling_Colony_Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1203vZyktuA_R3KwnG9uSV3JXkkiTA-um) and [Acropora_Sampling_Colony_Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19YCW-KpNBIq2hraZCzva5vsIAdVH9cLC) for the March 2022 timepoint. 

### Data
All timepoint and tracking data sheets for the March 2022 timepoint for both [*Pocillopora*](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1w3KdwBZaaAFh8UdbOXM3KZCofldOC53i) and [*Acropora*](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YSVr335RNhZXcJyI0TOSr_edmDsTy4zw) were updated.
