### *Histological processing*

Following the [histological processing protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2022-04-16-Histological-Processing.md) Danielle checked the histological samples and saw that many had completely been decalcified within 24 hours. She checked that the samples were still acidic and left them longer.

### *Sampling day prep*

Labeled and prepped all items for sampling in the backreef and forereef in the next two days.

### *Spawning inventory*

Inventoried multiple materials needed for spawning trip starting in September.


### *Symbiont counts*

Started symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 32 POC TPC samples. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [POC TPC Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EOHVhSjcK0rSPj0nupe7qTm1K4ONKAQs) and the [POC ID GitHub](https://github.com/hputnam/Poc_ID/tree/master/Ranalysis).
