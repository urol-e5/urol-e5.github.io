## *Respirometry*

Danielle and I followed the [Respirometry Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-12-14-SDR-Respirometry-Protocol.md) and completed 3 runs of photosynthesis and respiration with 24 fragments of *Acropora pulchra* from TP2.

## *Addition of heaters*

Danielle and I placed heaters in the 12 heated tanks in preparation for the heatwave ramp starting Sunday, March 27th. 

## *Data tracking*

All respirometry metadata and tracking were uploaded to the [heatwave timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/heatwave).
