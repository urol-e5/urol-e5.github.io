### *Tank Updates*
Danielle assigned the remaining 6 Apex temperature probes to their respective [Apex PM1](https://www.recifart.com/en/neptune-systems/1423-apex-ph-orp-probe-module-pm1.html) units to prep them for setting up during the heatwave. She also made all the settings and outlet updates for the second [Apex Controller System](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/apex-controller-system-neptune-systems.html) to follow her planned ramping of temperatures. All of the outlets are linked to the [Putnam Lab Apex fusion](https://apexfusion.com/apex) account to be able to set planned diel temperatures each day. Danielle also began breaking down the 6 large tanks she had set-up for preliminery testing. 

### *Data Control - Gametogenesis Project and Heatwave Project*
Danielle and Lauren spent time to update all data folders and metadata for the [Gametogenesis Project](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16MRkEmqtexqxClifcpm9qUH9ATkP6NHS) thus far. They also made a [general freezer and fridge list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nDgpn11vObWHyRcG5Qb2NstzV8tTP647Pb6OeyUiF-0/edit#gid=188537743) to track all samples and updated their project goals and schedule. All samples collected and sampled thus far have been tracked on multiple data sheets and are being constantly checked off as we go to keep track! Danielle also made metadata and sampling data sheets for the upcoming [heatwave experiment](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw).
