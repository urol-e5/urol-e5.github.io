This post includes the full notebook for Sept-Oct 2022 *Acropora* coral spawning and field expedition in Moorea, French Polynesia. These notebook posts are updated in order of most recent to oldest. 

# Project Overview  

The goal of this field expedition is to conduct spawning research in September and October in *Acropora* spp. 

A. Huffmyer is conducting field work to invesigate metabolic integration of coral host and symbiont in early life history as part of funded National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship and the University of Washington eScience Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship. More information on the abstract of this award can be [found here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2205966&HistoricalAwards=false).

### *Histology time series sampling*  

We conducted the September time point of histology time series sampling at Mahana for *Acropora pulchra* and *Pocillopora* sp. Protocols and more information on this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/protocols) and on the [E5 public notebook in previous posts](https://urol-e5.github.io/).  

This time series tracks gametogenesis through histology associated with Danielle's PhD research. For this sampling we collected fragments of n=40 *A. pulchra* and n=10 *Pocillopora* tagged colonies at Mahana site. We collected fragments from 0900-1300. 

Fragments were then processed from 1400-1600 in the lab. Clippings of each fragment were preserved for histology, molecular samples (flash frozen and in DNA RNA shield), and physiology.  

DANIELLE INSERT MORE INFO HERE IF NEEDED  

### *Sampling*  

We again checked for spawning by stopping the water and pumps in all tanks at 2000 to watch for setting in collected colonies. We did not see setting by 2300. There was no spawning.

### *Colony collection*    

Parent colonies were collected from the Mahana site on Moorea's north shore.  

![field site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/mahana.png) 

We first collected n=24 colonies for Danielle's project at 0800-0900 at the Mahana field site. We transported these colonies back to Gump station at 1000. 

DANIELLE INSERT INFO HERE ON YOUR COLONIES  

We then collected n=25 colonies (approx. 15-30cm in diameter) from large patches of *Acropora pulchra* from the Mahana field site between 1000-1200. We have a year-long project that has been tracking histology and physiology of colonies (Danielle's project) at this site and therefore we have temperature and light data from this site as environmental context. The colonies collected are considered "wildtype" and were not taken from tagged colonies. Colonies were collected from different patches to obtain a genetically diverse sample. 

Ariana and Danielle used a hammer and chisel to remove large fragments (15-30cm diameter) from these patches. Ariana Danielle and Pierrick transported them back to the boat where they were kept in coolers and buckets filled with seawater. Colonies were then transported back to Gump station at 1230 and placed in 2 flow through seawater tanks (n=12-13 colonies per tank). Tanks are equipped with 3 small recirculating pumps for water flow and had high water flow.   

![parents tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/colonies_tank.jpeg) 

These colonies will be used to collect wildtype gametes to rear to larval stages for Ariana's project. Spawn will be collected from each of the 2 tanks with wildtype colonies.  

### *Launching loggers*  

Temperature loggers were launched to track temperature in the adult parent tanks (n=2 tanks for Danielle and n=2 tanks for Ariana; N=4 loggers) and larval conicals (n=4 conicals per blue tank; N=16 loggers).  

Black Onset Hobo loggers were launched in each parent tank at 1900. Pendant Onset Hobo loggers were launched in larval conicals at 2200. Loggers are set to collect data every 10 minutes. At the end of the experiment we will need to do a group calibration to calculate offsets for the loggers.  The loggers and location are as follows:  

| Logger SSN  | Tank |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 20444040    | DBP Parent 2 |
| 20719656    | Wildtype Parent 2 |
| 20444033    | Wildtype Parent 1 |
| 20946644    | Wildtype Parent 1 |
| 21002982    | Conical A1 |
| 21002974    | Conical A2 |
| 21002979    | Conical A3 |
| 21002972    | Conical A4 |
| 21002981    | Conical B1 |
| 21335980    | Conical B2 |
| 21335987    | Conical B3 |
| 20937873    | Conical B4 |
| 21002977    | Conical C1 |
| 21335982    | Conical C2 |
| 20937872    | Conical C3 |
| 21002980    | Conical C4 |
| 21335986    | Conical D1 |
| 21335983    | Conical D2 |
| 21002975    | Conical D3 |
| 21335984    | Conical D4 |  

Loggers were placed at the bottom of tanks. Pendants were positioned upright to measure light as well as temperature.  

### *Apex system* 
 
Apex temperature probes were calibrated at 2230 using a digital thermometer (Traceable). Temperatures were between 26.1 and 26.4 for all tanks at the time of calibration.    

### *Tank set up*  

We have been having problems with the water flow not keeping up with demand in the spawning systems with low flow coming from the cooler float valve. Ariana fixed this by cleaning the float valves to remove shell fragments and cutting tubing to go straight from the outlet to the float valve with no slack. To keep the system clean, we will purge the line before starting water flow to the coolers and will regularly check the float valves for shells or debris.  

Tanks are now set up and running! We will add temperature control in the next few days.   

### *Spawning*  

Spawning equipment and workflows were set up. Danielle prepared supplies and equipment to measure eggs per bundle, take samples of sperm and eggs for molecular responses, measure fecundity on sample fragments, and fertilize by parent treatment history. See Danielle's [notebook](https://daniellembecker.github.io/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/) and the [E5 public notebook](https://urol-e5.github.io/) for more information on her project. 

DANIELLE INSERT INFORMATION ON YOUR SPAWNING HERE  

Ariana gathered supplies needed for wildtype spawning. The protocol for Ariana's spawning work will be as follows:  

See a detailed post on this [protocol here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Montipora-capitata-spawning-and-larval-rearing-protocol/). 

1. Use gravy separators and mesh bottom cups to collect floating bundles from each of the large parent tanks. Count the number of parents that released to contribute to the gamete pool. Gather gametes into a bucket/bowl. 
2. Once all bundles are released, pool all gametes and gently mix. 
3. Alloquot 5 mL of bundles into each of 16-20 50 mL falcon tubes. 
4. Gently add 40 mL of filtered (50 um) seawater to each falcon tube. 
5. Allow falcon tubes to rest gently sideways with occassional gentle rocking for approx. 1 hour or until bundles are broken apart and eggs and sperm are allowed to mix. 
6. Remove the sperm water from the falcon tube using a pipette and add 10 mL of new filtered seawater to rinse the eggs. Remove this water. 
7. Pour the eggs into the conicals. Use 1 falcon tube for each conical. Have low water flow in the conicals. 
8. Place extra material if available into the 5 gallon buckets with filtered seawater using the same proceedure. 
9. Check the concial cultures every hour. Remove dead material with a pipette, gently mix, and use kim wipes to remove lipid films.  
10. Gently increase the water flow the next morning and continue hourly checks and cleaning.  

We stopped the water and pumps in all tanks at 2000 to watch for setting in collected colonies. We did not see setting by 2300. There was no spawning. Red lights only were used to look at colonies.

### *Set up*  

Today we continued setting up tanks and unpacking and organizing supplies. We continued assembling portable spawning systems in preparation for spawning. We made and purchased supplies for banjo filters for larval tanks and Gump staff assisted us with installing filtration systems for our water lines. 

This is what our spawninig sytems look like and a full protocol is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPcQGoKwVJidsff5xrbiKTevRrtkKmqbUoALj0bd230/edit#gid=0). These systems (pictured below) contain a cooler that acts as a header tank and can be controlled with heaters in combination with a Neptune Apex system. We will set this up in the comiing days. The water in the cooler is sourced from a seawater output. The water in the cooler is then pumped out to a PVC manifold that then delivers water to each larval tank. The larval tanks (i.e., conicals or "squaricals") each have a banjo filter to allow for low thorugh seawater with large surface area to prevent embryos being damaged or lost on the drain. We set up four of these systems this week.

![Tanks2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/conicals.jpeg) 

![Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/filters.jpeg) 

We set up 4 portable spawning systems each with a cooler and 6 larval conicals in a blue tank. Two of these tanks are for Ariana (labelled A and B) and two are for Danielle (labelled C and D). This provides each of us with a high and ambient temperature system. Tanks A and C will be the high temperature tanks and tanks B and D will be ambient temperature.   

We also talked through plans for spawninig and discussed potential protocols for measuring reproductive metrics for Danielle. 

Finally, we prepared 6 extra buckets in a blue tank as extra space in case we have more gametes than can fit in the conicals. These buckets will contain seawater and sit in a water bath. They will not be flow through and will require water changes during embryo rearing.  

### *Apex system* 

Ariana set up two units of Apex systems in preparation for temperature control in larval conicals. There is one Apex unit for Ariana and one unit for Danielle. This will allow for temperature monitoring in n=3 in each tank (A, B, C, D). The temperature of the conicals will be controlled based on the temperature readings in one high temperature conical. Each Apex system consists of the following parts: 

1 Energy Bar AB8
1 Apex control unit 
5 PM1 modules 
6 Aquabus cables 
6 Apex temperature probes 

Apex units were connected to WiFi and created virtual outlets for each stage of temperature control. The Apex format looks like this:  

![Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/master/images/Moorea2022/apex_example.png) 

We have the Apex systems named "AH Moorea Sq" and "DBP Moorea Sq".

### *Setup*  

Today we arrived in Moorea, French Polynesia. Goals for the day were to unpack supplies, assess space and materials and start experimental set up. 

We will be constructing portable spawning systems developed in the Putnam Lab by Ariana Huffmyer and Jill Ashey. A full protocol for these systems and parts list is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPcQGoKwVJidsff5xrbiKTevRrtkKmqbUoALj0bd230/edit#gid=0).  

To prepare for spawning we cleaned and prepared tanks and started seawater flow. We will be using 4 large tanks to hold adult/parent colonies and 4 smaller tanks to hold the spawning systems. Ariana and Pierrick cleaned and filled tanks and constructed drain PVC systems for each tank. Danielle prepared the bins and tanks in water tables that she is using for her project. We unpacked an dorganized the lab equipment.
