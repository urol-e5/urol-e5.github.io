### *Symbiont counts*

Lauren and I continued symbiont counts following the [Symbiont density protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) for 73 corals collected in January and February 2022. All data and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries). 

### *Tank preliminary testing notes*

Diel temperature cycle was set to the highest temperature flux my experiment will experience from 28.7 C to 30.0 C. The 150 watt heaters are still working well, however, I noticed that the HOBO temp/light pendent loggers seemed to be reading higher than expected. I made sure that the thermometer that we are using for spot measurements was accurate and matched other lab groups (CSUN). I then deployed another more accurate [HOBO temperature logger](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/u22-001/) in tanks 2 and 4 next to the HOBO pendent light/temperature loggers to check the consistencey.
