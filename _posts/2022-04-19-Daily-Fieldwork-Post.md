## 19 April 2022

### *Returning colonies and fragments*
Danielle and Lauren returned all 24 *Acropora pulchra* colonies to the Mahana site (17°29'12.5"S 149°53'16.1"W) for monthly sampling. Following the [Field Sampling Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Field-Sampling-Protocol.md). They put the colonies around Patch 3. The remaining 2 fragments in each tank (numbers 6 and 7) were brought to CRIOBE for transplantation into their *in situ* coral trees for coral restoration purposes. 

### *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies for the last time and completed daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. 

### *Histological processing*
Following the [histological processing protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2022-04-16-Histological-Processing.md) Danielle checked the histological samples and saw that more fragments had decalcified, but the acid was become neutralized in the cups so she added 10 more mLs of the 10% HCl solution to each cup. 

### *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
