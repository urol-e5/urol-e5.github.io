## 30 March 2022

### *Heatwave*
Danielle ketp the heatwave ramp period a second day to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 28.9 °C to 29.6 °C.

### *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

### *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), Danielle put all the pans in the muffle furnace to be pre-burned.

### *Chlorophyll*
Lauren completed the [chlorophyll quantification protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md) for all TP2 samples.

### *Surface Area*
Lauren followed the [surface area protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-02-17-Surface-Area-Protocol.md) and recorded surface area measurements for all TP2 samples.


### *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).
