## *Heatwave*
Danielle started the sixth day of the heatwave period for the corals to to experience a diel fluctuation in the heated treatement of 29.4 °C to 30.1 °C.

## *Daily measurements*
Danielle recorded bleaching score and survivorship for the fragments and colonies  and completed 2 daily measurements of light, temperature, salinity and pH. She also cleaned the tanks.

## *Data tracking*
All daily measurements, bleaching score, and survivorship tracking for the colonies and fragments can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) and [Gametogenesis GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).

## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed twelve symbiont counts from TP2 which can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XjJUqWlBUcQ3gkTz14-S40f86YkT71feAB96AMA3Wis/edit#gid=0). She also cleaned tanks with Danielle and fed the feeding experiment corals for 30 minutes starting at 17:30.
