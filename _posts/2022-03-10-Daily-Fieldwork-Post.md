### *chlorophyll*

Danielle and Lauren followed the [Chlorophyll Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md) for 73 samples collected in January and February.

### *data entry*
Danielle and I entered remaining data for all physiological assays so far: homogenate volume, surface area, symbiont counts, and chlorophyll for 73 samples collected in January and February.

### *meeting with Tony*
Danielle met with Tony to further discuss the logistics of the heater and chillers in the tanks.
