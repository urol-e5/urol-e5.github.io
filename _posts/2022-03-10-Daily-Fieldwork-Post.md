### *Chlorophyll*

Danielle and Lauren followed the [Chlorophyll Protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md) for 73 samples collected in January and February. All platemaps and statistics were uploaded to the [Gametogenesis Project Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KSkMOiGlpIDJ80WWa3U5HESVHea4GNIu) and the [Gametogenesis Timeseries GitHub](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/tree/main/gametogenesis_timeseries). 

### *Data entry*
Danielle and I entered remaining data for all physiological assays so far: homogenate volume, surface area, symbiont counts, and chlorophyll for 73 samples collected in January and February.

### *Meeting with Tony*
Danielle met with Tony to further discuss the logistics of the heater and chillers in the tanks.
