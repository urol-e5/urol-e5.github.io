## *Symbiont counts*

Lauren completed the remainder of the  symbiont counts from TP2 which can be found on the [Heatwave Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XjJUqWlBUcQ3gkTz14-S40f86YkT71feAB96AMA3Wis/edit#gid=0). She also cleaned tanks with Danielle and fed the feeding experiment corals for 30 minutes starting at 17:30.
