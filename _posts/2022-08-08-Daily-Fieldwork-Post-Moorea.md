### *Total protein*
Danielle completed the [total protein protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md) for May, June, July, and POC TPC host samples. 

### *Ash-free dry weight*
Following the [ash-free dry weight protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Ash-Free-Dry-Weight-Protocol.md), the May, June, July *Acropora pulchra* timeseries and the *Pocillopora* TPC samples were weighed for the final ash weight from the muffle furnace.
