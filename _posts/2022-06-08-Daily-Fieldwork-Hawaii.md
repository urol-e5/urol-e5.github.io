## 8 June 2022

### *Expedition Overview*  

The purpose of this field expedition is to conduct research during the spawning season for the coral *Montipora capitata* and the larval brooding season for *Pocillopora acuta* in Hawaii. Jill Ashey and Ariana Huffmyer (Putnam Lab, URI) and collaborators are conducting research at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in June - July 2022. Projects include characterization of the role of microRNA in coral development [see J. Ashey's notebook here](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and the timing of symbiotic nutritional exchange [see A. Huffmyer's notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/). 

### *Tank Setup and Cleaning*  

Jill, Ariana, and collaborator Sarah T. (PhD student, Dr. Padilla Gamino lab at University of Washington) cleaned and set up tank space for experiments during this expedition. These tanks will be used for temperature and pH manipulation studies. 

Here is what the tanks looked like before:

And here is what they look like at the end of the day!

Tomorrow we will set up temperature and pH control systems and prepare larval rearing vessels.  

### *Laboratory Setup* 

Jill and Ariana organized and inventoried supplies at HIMB and organized the indoor lab space.
