## 15 June 2022

### *Expedition Overview*  

The purpose of this field expedition is to conduct research during the spawning season for the coral *Montipora capitata* and the larval brooding season for *Pocillopora acuta* in Hawaii. Jill Ashey and Ariana Huffmyer (Putnam Lab, URI) and collaborators are conducting research at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in June - July 2022. Projects include characterization of the role of microRNA in coral development [see J. Ashey's notebook here](https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/) and the timing of symbiotic nutritional exchange [see A. Huffmyer's notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/). 

### *Larval collection*  

There was more larval output today. It appears larval release may be ramping up. Larval release is still low, but increasing. We will use the larvae for practicing larval protocols tomorrow.     

### *Field work*  

Today we went to Reef 13 in Kaneohe Bay to collect live fragments from *Montipora capitata* bleaching pairs to ship to URI later next week. We were successful in finding most pairs that we were interested in. We did not sample from colonies with low biomass left. We enjoyed a nice snorkel on Reef 13!  

### *Respiration protocols*  

We walked through the protocols to run respirometry measurements with larvae. We are writing detailed protocols to follow for the rest of the trip.  

### *Temperature treatments*   

The Apex was stable today and had good separation between treatments.
