### *Postdoctoral position in ecological modeling* 
*UCSB Marine Science Institute*

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral scholar to engage in research using Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models as part of a large collaborative project on predicting ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental-energetic-epigenetic linkages (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1921356&amp;HistoricalAwards=false).

The project uses metabolically complex reef building corals as a model system to test the connections between the environment, energetics, and epigenetics, but the proposed modeling aims to make predictions at ecological levels of biological organization. The appointee will be based at UCSB working with Drs. Holly Moeller and Roger Nisbet (both UCSB) and with Dr. Ross Cunning (Shedd Aquarium, Chicago).

The starting point for the research will be a published DEB model of the symbiotic interaction between reef building corals and their symbionts. Immediate priorities are to expand the model to include calcification and thermal responses and to parameterize the model for selected corals in Moorea, French Polynesia, by linking experimental molecular profile data into DEB models to quantify energetic and growth responses.
